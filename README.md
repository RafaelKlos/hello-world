# hello-world
My first repository:\n
i am re-starting to learn programming, i already did some works on c while i were at the begining of my graduation, but i stopped, learned about 3d printing, learned about woodworking, changed the graduation from Electronical Engineering to Production Engineering, a derivative from Mechanical Engineering, now i am loving the course, really fitted everything i want, and programming oriented to data science and supply chain is my focus right now, the combination of this two areas that i like will create a explosive mixture, and this is the reason why i am here.
